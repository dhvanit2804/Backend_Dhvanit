# Program: Demonstrate correct use of indentation, comments, and variables
# Author: Dhvanit Parate
# Description: This program calculates and displays the area of a rectangle.

# Variable declarations (use lowercase_with_underscores for variable names)
length = 10
width = 5

# Calculate the area (use proper spacing around operators)
area = length * width

# Display the result with proper indentation
print("Length of rectangle:", length)
print("Width of rectangle:", width)
print("Area of rectangle:", area)
